## Benefits of Objects

**Why use objects over separate variables?**

- **Organized, maintainable code**
  - Related data stays together
  - Easy to find and update

- **Easier to pass around related data**
  - One parameter instead of many
  - Clear relationships

- **Foundation for more advanced patterns**
  - Classes, inheritance, composition
  - Design patterns and architectures

```javascript
// Easy to pass complete habit data
function saveHabit(habit) {
  localStorage.setItem(`habit_${habit.id}`, JSON.stringify(habit));
}

// Easy to work with collections
const habits = [exerciseHabit, readingHabit, meditationHabit];
habits.forEach(habit => habit.complete());
```
<Notes>
These benefits represent a fundamental shift from scattered programming to organized programming. Let's explore why each benefit transforms your development experience.

**Organized, maintainable code** is about cognitive load - how much you need to remember while programming. With separate variables, you're constantly juggling multiple pieces of information. When fixing a bug in habit tracking, you need to remember: "What variables store habit data? Which functions modify them? What happens if I update one but forget another?" Objects eliminate this mental overhead. Everything related to a habit lives in the habit object. Need to modify habit behavior? Look at the habit object. Need to add a new property? Add it to the habit object.

The maintainability benefit compounds over time. Six months from now, when you're adding a new feature, objects serve as documentation. The habit object clearly shows what properties and methods exist. With scattered variables, you're archaeology - digging through code to understand what exists and how it connects.

**Easier parameter passing** solves the "parameter explosion" problem. Compare these function signatures:

```javascript
// Without objects - parameter explosion
function updateHabit(id, name, category, streak, isActive, lastCompleted) { ... }

// With objects - clean interface
function updateHabit(habit) { ... }
```

The object version is impossible to get wrong. You can't accidentally swap the order of parameters. Adding new properties doesn't break existing function calls. The function signature becomes self-documenting - it works with habit objects.

**Foundation for advanced patterns** is about future-proofing your code. Objects teach you to think in terms of entities and their behaviors. This mental model scales to more sophisticated patterns: classes (templates for creating objects), inheritance (objects that extend other objects), and composition (objects that contain other objects). These patterns power large applications, frameworks, and libraries.

The code examples show practical benefits. The saveHabit function works with any habit object - it doesn't need to know about individual properties. The forEach example demonstrates how objects enable functional programming patterns. Each habit knows how to complete itself; we just tell each one to do it.
